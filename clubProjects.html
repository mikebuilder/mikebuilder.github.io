				<u><b>Description</b></u><br/>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWPI's chapter of the Society of Automotive Engineers is an on-campus club dedicated to engaging and educating students about automotive engineering.  
				Currently, the club's primary focus is the annual international Formula SAE competition in Michigan, however we also work on legacy cars from the SAE Baja competition, and are considering getting into Formula Electric.  
				Each year, the club works with an MQP(major qualifying project) team of WPI seniors to design a new frame and compete.  
				
				<br/>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
				This year I am working on developing the bodywork for the car, which will be manufactured from carbon fiber using vaccuum infusion.  
				The main focus for the bodywork on this year's car is to reduce drag, as well as to minimize weight.  
				I am also doing my IQP(interdisciplinary qualifying project) in tandem with SAE to develop educational materials for new members in order to improve new member retention after the fall semester.
				We are running educational seminars each weekend consisting of a short lecture about a major automotive system, such as vehicle dynamics, followed by a hands-on activity where participants can apply what they have learned, and get a chance to work together.
				The 6 seminars consist of an intro to SAE and the FSAE competition, Engines, Manufacturing, Electronics and Aero, Vehicle dynamics, and understanding driver strategies when racing.
				Check out our team's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/wpisae/">facebook page</a> to see updates about the current development process.

				<u><b>Description</b></u><br/>
					&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Botball robotics competition is a highschool robotics competition in which teams build fully autonomous robots that have to perform certain tasks within a time limit.
					Each year, the tasks to perform hinge around a central theme, like surviving on mars, with tasks like collecting dirt samples(pom poms) and sorting them based on mineral components(color).
					Each team builds two indpendent robots, using an iRobot create as a base for one, and controls them using competition specifc programmableable control units.
					I joined the team in my first year of highschool, and participated all four years, eventually becoming one of two team captains: I was in charge of the mechanical build of both robots.
					Our greatest success came in my third year, when we came in third place overall at the Massachusetts regional competition, and were awarded a judge's choice award for the best robot build, in recognition of how reliably our robots scored points.

				<u><b>Description</b></u><br/>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTen80 is a national competition for highschool students that focuses on teaching engineering principles through their applications to remote controlled cars.
				The main objective of the competition is to build and modify a stock remote control car to perform as well as possible, within certain mechanical and electrical restrictions on things like motor size, battery capacity and driveline layout.
				Additionally, there is a buisiness portion of the competition that teaches students how to present a buisiness proposal to potential investors.
				I participated on my school's team for all 4 years of highschool, of which we made it from regional competitions to nationals 3 times, and won two consecutive years.
				I was a team captain for the last 2 years, and focused primarily on involving new members in the club and making it easily accessible for younger students.
